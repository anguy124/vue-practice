BEFORE RUNNING

You will notice a few new files, and a folder /dist.

I put all the things in /dist, and left /server.js in the root directory of your project.

Also used EXPRESS framework instead of plain http. Express makes things sooo much easier.

Before starting up the app, run this on the terminal (make sure you're in your project's directory):

"npm install"

This installs everything under "dependencies" in package.json file. A /node_modules folder also appears. That's where all dependencies of web apps live.

Then run node server.js
